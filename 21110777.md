## 4.2. Encryption Mode – ECB vs. CBC 
<span>Encrypt the file using the ECB (Electronic Code Book) and CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) 
modes:</span><br>
<span>CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) modes:</span><br>

<span>As we can see that we need the key K and iv. To do that we using these command:

=> We insert random value from key.bin and iv.bin to arguments KEY and IV.</span><br>
<span>Now we encrypted it with the following Key and iv:

<span style="color:blue">- View the encrypted picture i see that the encrypted image will appear much more random and will not reveal any discernible patterns from the original image. It aslo look like random noise with no identifiable structures or patterns from the original image.</span><br>
<span style="color:blue">- The reason for this is beacause CBC mode ensures that even if the plaintext blocks are identical, the resulting ciphertext blocks will be different due to the chaining mechanism. This makes CBC mode more secure against pattern analysis and provides better confidentiality for encrypted data with repeating patterns, such as images.</span><br>
<span>ECB (Electronic Code Book) modes:</span><br>

<span style="color:blue">- View the encrypted picture i see that the encrypted image will still show some patterns from the original image. You might see repeated blocks that resemble the structure of the original image. Even though the image is encrypted, it’s possible to infer some visual information and patterns from the original image.</span><br>
<span style="color:blue">- The reason for this is beacause ECB mode does not provide sufficient security for data with repeating patterns. Identical plaintext blocks are encrypted into identical ciphertext blocks, which can reveal patterns and potentially allow for some level of reverse engineering of the original image.</span><br>
<span style="color:blue">Conclusion:
By comparing the two encrypted images, you should see that:
- ECB Mode: The encrypted image retains some patterns and can reveal visual information about the original image. This demonstrates that ECB mode is not suitable for encrypting images or other data with repeating patterns.
- CBC Mode: The encrypted image appears random and does not reveal any useful information about the original image. This demonstrates that CBC mode provides better security and confidentiality for such data.

## 4.3. Encryption Mode – Corrupted Cipher Text
<span>To understand the properties of various encryption modes, do the following tasks:
1. Create a text file that is at least 64 bytes long: 
<img width="726" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-02 16516" src="https://github.com/DoomDayKross/Encrypting-Large-Message-Lab/blob/main/assets/Screenshot%202024-07-18%20135630.png?raw=true"><br>
2. Encrypt the file using the AES-256 cipher:
<img width="726" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-02 16516" src="https://github.com/DoomDayKross/Encrypting-Large-Message-Lab/blob/main/assets/Screenshot%202024-07-18%20135804.png?raw=true"><br>
3. A single bit of the 5th byte in the encrypted file presumably got corrupted, you can achieve this corruption using dd command.<br>

4. Decrypt the corrupted file (encrypted) using the correct key and IV.<br>
<img width="726" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-02 16516" src="https://github.com/DoomDayKross/Encrypting-Large-Message-Lab/blob/main/assets/Screenshot%202024-07-18%20142828.png?raw=true"><br>
<span style="color:blue">a. How much information can you recover by decrypting the corrupted file, if the encryption mode is ECB, CBC, CFB, or OFB, respectively? Please answer this question before you conduct this task, and then find out whether your answer is correct or wrong after you finish this task.</span><br>
<span>Before conducting the task, here's my theoretical expectation:
- ECB (Electronic Code Book): Corruption of one byte will affect only that byte. The rest of the data will be correctly decrypted.
- CBC (Cipher Block Chaining): Corruption of one byte will affect the current block and the subsequent block due to the chaining mechanism.
- CFB (Cipher Feedback): Corruption of one byte will affect the current byte and the subsequent bytes in the stream.
- OFB (Output Feedback): Corruption of one byte will affect only that byte. The rest of the data will be correctly decrypted.
</span><br>

<span style="color:blue">b. Explain</span><br>
<span>ECB Mode:
- Since ECB mode encrypts each block independently, corruption in the 5th byte will only affect that byte. The rest of the plaintext should be correctly decrypted.

CBC Mode:
- In CBC mode, corruption in the 5th byte will affect the entire block where the corrupted byte resides and will propagate the error to the next block due to the XOR operation with the previous ciphertext block.

CFB Mode:
- In CFB mode, corruption in the 5th byte will affect the corresponding plaintext byte and will propagate the error to the subsequent bytes in the stream.
OFB Mode:

In OFB mode, since it uses the encrypted output as the keystream and not the actual plaintext, corruption in one byte will only affect that byte. The rest of the plaintext should be correctly decrypted.
</span><br>
<span style="color:blue">c. What is the implication of these differences ?</span><br>
<span>The differences in how each mode handles errors have important implications for their use:

- ECB Mode: While ECB mode allows for localized corruption, it is not suitable for encrypting data with patterns, as identical plaintext blocks produce identical ciphertext blocks. Its error recovery property might be useful in scenarios where localized errors are acceptable.

- CBC Mode: CBC mode provides better security for data with patterns but has the drawback of error propagation. This means that a single error can affect multiple blocks, making it less suitable for environments where error correction or data integrity is critical.

- CFB Mode: CFB mode also suffers from error propagation, affecting subsequent bytes. It is often used for stream encryption, where the feedback property is beneficial.

- OFB Mode: OFB mode does not propagate errors, making it suitable for situations where error recovery is important. It is similar to CFB mode but does not feedback the ciphertext into the encryption process, making it more resilient to bit errors.

Conclusion:<br>
<span style="color:blue">By performing these steps and observing the outcomes, you will be able to see how each encryption mode handles errors differently, which impacts their suitability for various applications.</span><br>
